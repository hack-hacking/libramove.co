## An Abstract View of a Blockchain

A blockchain is a replicated state machine \[4\]\[5\]. Replicators in the system are known as validators. Users of the system send transactions to validators. Each validator understands how to execute a transaction to transition its internal state machine from the current state to a new state.

Validators leverage their shared understanding of transaction execution to follow a consensus protocol for collectively defining and maintaining the replicated state. If

* the validators start from the same initial state, and 
* the validators agree on what the next transaction should be, and
* executing a transaction produces a deterministic state transition, 

then the validators will also agree on what the next state is. Repeatedly applying this scheme allows the validators to process transactions while continuing to agree on the current state. 

Note that the consensus protocol and the state transition components are not sensitive to each otherâ€™s implementation details. As long as the consensus protocol ensures a total order among transactions and the state transition scheme is deterministic, the components can interact in harmony.
