## Encoding Digital Assets in an Open System

The role of a blockchain programming language like Move is to decide how transitions and state are represented. To support a rich financial infrastructure, the state of the Libra Blockchain must be able to encode the owners of digital assets at a given point in time. Additionally, state transitions should allow the transfer of assets.

There is one other consideration that must inform the design of a blockchain programming language. Like other public blockchains, the Libra Blockchain is an open system. Anyone can view the current blockchain state or submit transactions to a validator \(i.e., propose state transitions\). Traditionally, software for managing digital assets \(e.g., banking software\) operates in a closed system with special administrative controls. In a public blockchain, all participants are on equal footing. A participant can propose any state transition she likes, yet not all state transitions should be allowed by the system. For example, Alice is free to propose a state transition that transfers assets owned by Bob. The state transition function must be able to recognize that this state transition is invalid and reject it.

It is challenging to choose a representation of transitions and state that encodes ownership of digital assets in an open software system. In particular, there are two properties of physical assets that are difficult to encode in digital assets:

* **Scarcity**. The supply of assets in the system should be controlled. Duplicating existing assets should be prohibited, and creating new assets should be a privileged operation. 
* **Access control**. A participant in the system should be able to protect her assets with access control policies.

To build intuition, we will see how these problems arise during a series of strawman proposals for the representation of state transitions. We will assume a blockchain that tracks a single digital asset called a StrawCoin. The blockchain state G is structured as a key-value store that maps user identities \(represented with cryptographic public keys\) to natural number values that encode the StrawCoin held by each user. A proposal consists of a transaction script that will be evaluated using the given evaluation rule, producing an update to apply to the global state. We will write G\[𝐾\] := 𝑛 to denote updating the natural number stored at key 𝐾 in the global blockchain state with the value 𝑛.
