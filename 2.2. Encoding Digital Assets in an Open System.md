## Encoding Digital Assets in an Open System

The role of a blockchain programming language like Move is to decide how transitions and state are represented. To support a rich financial infrastructure, the state of the Libra Blockchain must be able to encode the owners of digital assets at a given point in time. Additionally, state transitions should allow the transfer of assets.

There is one other consideration that must inform the design of a blockchain programming language. Like other public blockchains, the Libra Blockchain is an open system. Anyone can view the current blockchain state or submit transactions to a validator \(i.e., propose state transitions\). Traditionally, software for managing digital assets \(e.g., banking software\) operates in a closed system with special 2 administrative controls. In a public blockchain, all participants are on equal footing. A participant can propose any state transition she likes, yet not all state transitions should be allowed by the system. For example, Alice is free to propose a state transition that transfers assets owned by Bob. The state transition function must be able to recognize that this state transition is invalid and reject it.
